# csvConverter

Need to create an '.env' file with your configuration to access your snowflake db.
Use this sample:

    SNOWFLAKE_USER=''
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=''
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=''
    SNOWFLAKE_REGION=''
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=''
    SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=''
    SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=''
    SNOWFLAKE_ROLE='L'
      
Also you have to import your csv file and define the queries you want to do in the database.
